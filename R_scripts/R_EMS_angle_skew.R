# Outlier detection EMS angle ####

#massively misspositioned embryos due to tilted EMS division: GM23, GM24, GM19, PM23, GM6
#these are real outliers with massively messed up cell positioning mostly due to EMS division axis twisted

#among controls:
#GM31 corrects EMS spindle quickly
#GM54 corrects EMS spindle quickly
#GM14 corrects EMS spindle quickly 
#MM6 corrects EMS spindle, but problem with skewing AB cells left/right 

#PM28 has quite mild phenotype, corrects, but MSa/p is flipped later, kept in the dataset
#GM36 is extremely misspositioned, with ABpl division being skewed and C P3 positions totally off
#PM23 is the most extreme outlier
